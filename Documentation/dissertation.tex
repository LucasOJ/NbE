% The document class supplies options to control rendering of some standard
% features in the result.  The goal is for uniform style, so some attention 
% to detail is *vital* with all fields.  Each field (i.e., text inside the
% curly braces below, so the MEng text inside {MEng} for instance) should 
% take into account the following:
%
% - author name       should be formatted as "FirstName LastName"
%   (not "Initial LastName" for example),
% - supervisor name   should be formatted as "Title FirstName LastName"
%   (where Title is "Dr." or "Prof." for example),
% - degree programme  should be "BSc", "MEng", "MSci", "MSc" or "PhD",
% - dissertation title should be correctly capitalised (plus you can have
%   an optional sub-title if appropriate, or leave this field blank),
% - dissertation type should be formatted as one of the following:
%   * for the MEng degree programme either "enterprise" or "research" to
%     reflect the stream,
%   * for the MSc  degree programme "$X/Y/Z$" for a project deemed to be
%     X%, Y% and Z% of type I, II and III.
% - year              should be formatted as a 4-digit year of submission
%   (so 2014 rather than the academic year, say 2013/14 say).

% =============================================================================

% This macro creates the standard UoB title page by using information drawn
% from the document class (meaning it is vital you select the correct degree 
% title and so on).

\maketitle

% After the title page (which is a special case in that it is not numbered)
% comes the front matter or preliminaries; this macro signals the start of
% such content, meaning the pages are numbered with Roman numerals.

\frontmatter

% This macro creates the standard UoB declaration; on the printed hard-copy,
% this must be physically signed by the author in the space indicated.

\makedecl

% LaTeX automatically generates a table of contents, plus associated lists 
% of figures, tables and algorithms.  The former is a compulsory part of the
% dissertation, but if you do not require the latter they can be suppressed
% by simply commenting out the associated macro.

\tableofcontents

% \listoffigures
% \listoftables
% \listofalgorithms
% \lstlistoflistings

% The following sections are part of the front matter, but are not generated
% automatically by LaTeX; the use of \chapter* means they are not numbered.

\chapter*{Executive Summary}

% {\bf A compulsory section, of at most $1$ page} 

% \noindent
% This section should pr\'{e}cis the project context, aims and objectives,
% and main contributions (e.g., deliverables) and achievements; the same 
% section may be called an abstract elsewhere.  The goal is to ensure the 
% reader is clear about what the topic is, what you have done within this 
% topic, {\em and} what your view of the outcome is.
% 
% The former aspects should be guided by your specification: essentially 
% this section is a (very) short version of what is typically the first 
% chapter.  Note that for research-type projects, this {\bf must} include 
% a clear research hypothesis.  This will obviously differ significantly
% for each project, but an example might be as follows:


Haskell is an industrial strength functional programming language. In this project we investigate if modern compiler extensions can be used to emulate features of languages with full dependent types. We also assess how practical these extensions are. We do this by implementing variations of Normalisation by Evaluation, an algorithm with complex types.

\noindent
\begin{quote}
      My research hypothesis is that Haskell extensions are powerful enough to implement Normalisation by Evaluation for the Simply Typed Lambda Calculus. 
\end{quote}

\noindent
In this project we

\begin{itemize}
\item Implement two variations of Normalisation by Evaluation for the untyped lambda calculus in  Haskell, see Chapter \ref{chap:untypednbe}, following mathematical specifications.
\item Translate an Agda implementation of Normalisation by Evaluation into Haskell using compiler extensions, see Chapter \ref{chap:typednbe}, which demonstrates that the research hypothesis was correct.
\item Evaluate the practical use of the features enabled by compiler extensions, and recommend their use in instances where type-safety is the primary goal, see Chapter \ref{chap:evaluation}.
\end{itemize}

% =============================================================================

% After the front matter comes a number of chapters; under each chapter,
% sections, subsections and even subsubsections are permissible.  The
% pages in this part are numbered with Arabic numerals.  Note that:
%
% - A reference point can be marked using \label{XXX}, and then later
%   referred to via \ref{XXX}; for example Chapter\ref{chap:context}.
% - The chapters are presented here in one file; this can become hard
%   to manage.  An alternative is to save the content in seprate files
%   the use \input{XXX} to import it, which acts like the #include
%   directive in C.
