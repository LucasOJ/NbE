\chapter{Normalising the Typed Lambda Calculus}
\label{chap:typednbe}

Investigation: Are GADTs in Haskell powerful enough? Types are erased at runtime so true dependent typing not part of Haskell (programs at type level)

Advantage over ADTs: type refinement by constructor

Poissible to erase all type information, NbE on Untyped
Issue: No proof that type preserved 
Solution: Track types as do evaluation - nbe program itself proof that types preserved (subject reduction parallel?)

Started by implementing same as untyped

Main difference in semantics (V := a -> b | Neutral) 
\cite{slides}

problem: Need to strengthen context evaluating body (eval Lam case)
\subsection{Solution: Order Preserving Embeddings (OPEs)}

Following implementation in Agda \cite{AgdaNbe}, agda has full dependent types (type system more powerful) - adapt for haskell, how nicely? 

if a term well typed for one context, also well typed for any longer one

A value of type 'OPE strong weak' can derive weak from strong by dropping elements from context

OPE is a relation on typing contexts

\subsection{Semantic set}

Defintion of V using OPEs - Haskell vs agda

Need to quantify over 'strong' in function - OPE strong weak is guarentee that strong is a stronger context than weak (if quantified at start end up with values where weak stronger than strong) - need rank2 types extension for nested quantification

Helper functions (composition, strengthing relative to OPE) - explain derivations

\subsection{implementing Eval}

Defintion of environment (maps expressions in syntax context ctx to values in semantics with context ctxV)

problem: in app case how to we get identity OPE for semantic context?

But types erased at compile time to make Haskell efficient

How to generate a value at runtime dependent on type erased at compile time

dependent pattern match \cite{SingletonsGuide}

\subsection{Solution: Singleton pattern}

Method of Type to value known as reflection \cite{SingletonsGuide}

Idea: Create value-level tags for types - singleton types correspond type we're interested in, inhabited by only one value for each case

Examples: Reify case analysis, Ty reflection, Context reflection

Explicitly passing as value to pattern match on

Generate implictly using typeclass, use class constraint to imiplictly pass down ability to use contex methods through function calls.
Is it a good idea to have class constraints in the GADTs/Syntax definitions?

Implementation in class vs full reflection - test this for speed?

problem : Inferring Any for ctxV (why?)

solution: scoped type variables - universally quantified variables used in type expressions bind over 'where' clause

(More usefully) can 'unpack' refined GADT types so that can create type definitions using refined types.

Analysis:

Have to specify type when normaling for correct eta-expansion (eta-long form)

Qs:
How does locally nameless work in sematics?
How does ctxV work in Env?
