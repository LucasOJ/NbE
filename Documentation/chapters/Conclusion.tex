\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}

% {\bf A compulsory chapter,     of roughly $5$ pages} 

% \noindent
% The concluding chapter of a dissertation is often underutilised because it 
% is too often left too close to the deadline: it is important to allocation
% enough attention.  Ideally, the chapter will consist of three parts:
% 
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item (Re)summarise the main contributions and achievements, in essence
%       summing up the content.
% \item Clearly state the current project status (e.g., ``X is working, Y 
%       is not'') and evaluate what has been achieved with respect to the 
%       initial aims and objectives (e.g., ``I completed aim X outlined 
%       previously, the evidence for this is within Chapter Y'').  There 
%       is no problem including aims which were not completed, but it is 
%       important to evaluate and/or justify why this is the case.
% \item Outline any open problems or future plans.  Rather than treat this
%       only as an exercise in what you {\em could} have done given more 
%       time, try to focus on any unexplored options or interesting outcomes
%       (e.g., ``my experiment for X gave counter-intuitive results, this 
%       could be because Y and would form an interesting area for further 
%       study'' or ``users found feature Z of my software difficult to use,
%       which is obvious in hindsight but not during at design stage; to 
%       resolve this, I could clearly apply the technique of Smith [7]'').
% \end{enumerate}

% Summary of what we did 
%   3 variations
%   possible to translate Agda implementation to Haskell with type guarentees

In this dissertation we produced three variations 

% Evaluation of Haskell language features in terms of typed NbE implementation
%    Singletons worked well, complex applications could struggle
%    Singleton library for automation
%    GADTs with DataKinds "good", type renfinement, moves errors to compile time.
%    type annotations, inference not as strong as type theories
%

% future work
    % Benchmarking against Haskell (motivation for Haskell faster)
    % Correctness proofs from \cite{AgdaNbe} translate over
